# BLOCKTRACTOR is a fully-decentralised smart-contract service marketplace built on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Blocktractor is a decentralised NFT Launchpad that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. As its name suggests—a portmanteau of both the words ‘block’ and ‘contractor’—our platform allows for a way for users to work on completing tasks required to take an entire NFT project from the drawing board all the way to first launch, all through smart contracts on the blockchain.  

With Blocktractor, users of the community can engage in various tasks that contribute to the completion of the NFT project. For example, designing of the artwork, engaging in marketing promotions, or coding of the NFT back-end logic. Through our platform, the contributions of each member are logged and publicly available for all to see, which provides for transparency and allows each member of the community to influence the direction of the project. In this way, the community can maximise on the strengths of each user and increase the chances of the NFT launch succeeding.
